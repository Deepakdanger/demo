            There are lots of ways to create web pages using already coded programmes. These lessons will
             teach you how to use the underlying HyperText Markup Language - HTML.
    
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML isn't computer code, but is a language that uses US <b>English</b>  to enable texts (words, images,
             sounds) to be inserted and formatting such as colo(u)r and centretering to be written in. 
             The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you 
             slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still
              be legible. However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages
               is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!
        </p>   
        <p>
            Learning HTML will enable you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>create your own simple pages</li>
              <li>read and appreciate pages created by others</li>
              <li>develop an understanding of the creative and literary implications of web-texts</li>
              <li> have the confidence to branch out into more complex web design</li>  
            </ul>
            
         
        <p>
            A HTML web page is made up of tags. Tags are placed in brackets like this < tag > . A tag tells 
            the browser how to display information. Most tags need to be opened < tag > and closed < /tag >.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make a simple web page you need to know only four tags:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML > tells the browser your page is written in HTML format</li>
                <li>HEAD > this is a kind of preface of vital information that doesn't appear on the screen.</li>
                
                 
            </ul>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            All these tags need to be closed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Write a simple web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copy out exactly the HTML below, using a WP program such as Notepad.
            Information in italics indicates where you can insert your own text, other information is 
            HTML and needs to be exact. However, make sure there are no spaces between the tag brackets and 
            the text inside.
            (Find Notepad by going to the START menu\ PROGRAMS\ ACCESSORIES\ NOTEPAD).
